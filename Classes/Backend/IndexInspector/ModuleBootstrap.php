 * This class is a wrapper for Web->Info controller of solr Index Inspector.
 * It is registered in ext_tables.php with \TYPO3\CMS\Core\Utility\ExtensionManagementUtility::insertModuleFunction()
 * and called by the info extension via SCbase functionality.
 *
 * Extbase currently provides no way to register a "TBE_MODULES_EXT"(third level module) module directly,
 * therefore we need to bootstrap extbase on our own here to jump to the Web->Info controller.
 * @todo: Remove this class and register 'ApacheSolrForTypo3\Solr\Controller\ApacheSolrDocumentController' in proper Extbase way if Web>Info is implemented with Extbase. See the class description before doing something.
